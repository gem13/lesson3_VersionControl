            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a way for multiple people to edit one document simultaneously. Version control 
            keeps track of each “version” of a document and records who changes what and when those changes were made. Version 
            control is very convenient for a number of reasons. One, each user has their own copy of a document that they can save 
            on their local repository. Another positive factor of version control is that it does not allow for files on one’s 
            local repository to be overwritten. Users don’t have to worry about losing their work when there are multiple users 
            editing the same document simultaneously. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To put it simply, a version control system is something that facilitates version control. A version 
            control system allows for the sharing, editing, and viewing of files by multiple users simultaneously. There are many 
            advantages to using version control systems. These advantages include: who changed what in a file, (also referred to 
            as revision history), when they files were changed and what exactly about the files we changed. Version control 
            systems also have the capability of merging changes into the same file.  Another perk of using a version control 
            system is that it allows users to revert back to a different version of a file. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When multiple users are editing and viewing project and files at the same time, their work can be 
            saved somewhere that everyone else can view. That place is a remote repository. Remote repositories provide the 
            convenience of multiple people having the same information and keeping multiple files organized. When someone wants 
            to view a file from a remote repository, they “pull” it from the repository onto their own repository and when they 
            are done editing a file, they then “push” the file back to the remote repository. Remote repositories are kept on a 
            remote server so the files can be easily shared.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When using a version control system, most users want to take files from the remote repository and edit 
            them on their own local computer. This process is done by “pulling” files from the remote repository and viewing them 
            on a local repository. A local repository is stored on an individual user’s local machine. There are two ways that a 
            user can create a local repository. The first method is to create a new repository all together. The second method is 
            a bit simpler. All the user has to do is clone or copy an existing repository onto their local machine.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a distributed version control system. There are many advantages to using GIT all of which 
            include: each user having a copy of the remote repository on their local machine, processes having the capability of 
            running faster, the prevention of one user overwriting another user’s work, everything remaining local, and not having 
            a single point of failure. There are different GIT commands that help the user keep track of their files. The two 
            categories of commands are basic commands and remote commands. While working with GIT, it is important to remember 
            the three basics steps: add, commit, and push. GIT is a very helpful and organized way to share and edit files 
            between numerous team members.</p>
